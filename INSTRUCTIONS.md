# The Quiet Dominion
## A Guide for New Rulers

---

### The Premise

You have found a valley—quiet, forgotten, promising. An ember still glows in the ash of those who came before. Stoke the fire, and begin.

---

### Core Mechanics

**Resources**
- 🌾 **Food** — Sustains your people. Without it, they cannot stay.
- 🪵 **Materials** — Wood, stone, metal. The bones of every structure.
- 👥 **Population** — Souls who call this place home. More hands, more work—more mouths.

Resources accumulate over time. Build structures to increase production rates and storage capacity.

---

### Building Your Settlement

Tap structures in the **Settlement** tab to build them. Each has:
- A **cost** (what you spend)
- An **effect** (what you gain)
- A **cap** (how many you can build)

Start with **Shelters** to house more people and **Farms** to feed them. As your settlement grows, new structures unlock.

---

### Advisors

Four advisors may join your council, each with their own perspective:

- **Maren** (The Practical) — Favors steady growth and full stores
- **Tomas** (The Builder) — Dreams of expansion and grand structures  
- **Elara** (The Keeper) — Values knowledge and patience
- **Corvus** (The Wanderer) — Understands the world beyond the valley

Listen to their counsel. Your choices affect their trust.

---

### Exploration

In the **Exploration** tab, send expeditions to discover territories:

1. Each territory requires **resources** and **time**
2. While exploring, you cannot send another expedition
3. Successful expeditions yield rewards: resources, new structures, and lore

---

### The Codex

Fragments of knowledge about the valley's past are scattered throughout. Discover them through events and exploration.

The **Codex** tab stores what you've learned. The mystery deepens with each fragment.

---

### Events & Dilemmas

Random events will test your judgment:
- Wanderers seeking shelter
- Storms threatening your stores
- Discoveries in the wilderness
- Your advisors' concerns

Each choice has consequences. There is rarely a "right" answer—only the path you choose.

### Prestige: Found a New Dominion

When your settlement reaches certain milestones (Day 50, 75 population, 15 structures), you may **Found a New Dominion**.

This resets your progress but grants **Legacy Points** based on your achievements. Use these to unlock permanent bonuses:

- **Remembered Ways** — Start with more resources
- **Efficient Builders** — Structures cost less

Choose an **Ending** when you prestige. Each reflects how you led your people.

### Tips for New Players

1. **Balance growth and stores.** Population eats food. Don't expand faster than you can feed.

2. **Build farms early.** Food is your foundation.

3. **Explore when stable.** Expeditions cost resources you might need for emergencies.

4. **Read the events.** The writing holds clues about the valley's mysteries.

5. **Time moves on its own.** The game runs even while you're away (up to 24 hours of progress).

6. **Save often.** Use the save button in the header, or let auto-save do its work.
